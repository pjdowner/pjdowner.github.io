summary: I got a new personal site!

Hi!

I finally have something to show in `pjd.me.uk` so that the site doesn't frustrate visitors by taking forever to load nothing and then timing out.

In this blog I may nerd about guitar stuff, embedded software, skating or metal music.
I can't promise regular updates though!

I don't mind web development but this domain has certainly been sitting empty for a while until my good friend [Octopus in Vitro](https://bsky.app/profile/octopusinvitro.bsky.social) gave me a site for Xmas made with Eleventy and hosted in Github. As you can see, the work is magnificent and you should throw Octopus lots of money (I promise Octopus didn't threaten me to write this).

Some things may still be breaking etc., if so please let me know.

Comments are coming soon, in the meanwhile, you can share this post!
